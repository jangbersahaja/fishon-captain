# Authentication System - Quick Summary

**Status**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Immediate action required  
**Date**: October 12, 2025

---

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Found

### 1. **`allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: true`** ⚠️ HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Risk**: Account takeover vulnerability  
**Fix**: Set to `false` immediately in `src/lib/auth.ts`

### 2. **No Email Verification**

**Risk**: Anyone can register with any email address  
**Impact**: Account takeover, spam registrations

### 3. **Weak Password Requirements**

**Current**: Only 8+ characters  
**Recommendation**: 12+ chars + complexity rules

### 4. **No Account Lockout**

**Risk**: Unlimited brute force attempts (only rate-limited)

### 5. **JWT-Only Sessions**

**Issue**: Cannot revoke sessions server-side  
**Impact**: Compromised tokens valid until expiry

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

- Multi-provider OAuth (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Role-based access control (CAPTAIN/STAFF/ADMIN)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Security headers (CSP, etc.)
- Environment validation
- Audit logging foundation

---

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### Must Do Now:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts - Line 43
GoogleProvider({
  clientId: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
  allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking: false, // ← Change this ASAP
});
```

### Quick Wins:

1. **Password strength** - Add validation library (5 mins)
2. **Signup rate limit** - Copy from signin pattern (10 mins)
3. **Account lockout** - Add 3 fields to User model (2 hours)
4. **Increase bcrypt rounds** - Change 10 → 12 (1 min)

## 📋 Full Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Critical Security (MUST DO)

- [ ] Fix `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking`
- [ ] Add email verification system
- [ ] Implement strong password validation
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Increase bcrypt rounds to 12

### Week 2: Password Management

- [ ] Build password reset flow
- [ ] Add "forgot password" functionality
- [ ] Implement password change endpoint
- [ ] Add security event logging

### Week 3: Session Management

- [ ] Switch from JWT to database sessions
- [ ] Build session management UI
- [ ] Add "active devices" view
- [ ] Implement session revocation

### Week 4: Advanced Security

- [ ] Add MFA/2FA support
- [ ] Implement backup codes
- [ ] Add suspicious login alerts
- [ ] Security audit & penetration test

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

After fixes:

- Failed login attempts per day
- Accounts locked per day
- MFA adoption rate
- Password reset completion rate

- Detailed code examples
- Complete implementation guides
- Testing strategies
- Migration plans

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Current Auth Flow

```
User → Sign in → JWT token → Middleware check → Protected route
```

### Improved Auth Flow

```
User → Sign in → Verify email → MFA (optional) →
Database session → Middleware check → Protected route
```

### Password Requirements (Proposed)

- ✅ Minimum 12 characters (current: 8)
- ✅ Upper + lowercase letters
- ✅ Numbers
- ✅ Special characters
- ✅ Not in common password list

### Account Lockout Logic

```
Failed attempts: 0-4 → Allow
Failed attempts: 5   → Lock 15 minutes
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Read full analysis**: `docs/guides/AUTH_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_AND_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
2. **Fix critical issue**: Change `allowDangerousEmailAccountLinking` to false
3. **Plan sprint**: Schedule 4 weeks for full implementation
4. **Set up tracking**: Add security metrics to dashboard

---

**Next Steps**:

1. Review this document with team
2. Prioritize which features to implement first
3. Set up project board for auth improvements
4. Schedule security audit after implementation
