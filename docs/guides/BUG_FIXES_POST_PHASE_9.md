# Bug Fixes - Post Phase 9 Testing

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: ✅ All Fixed  
**Context**: Issues found during manual testing after Phase 9 completion

## Overview

After completing Phase 9 (comprehensive testing plan), manual testing revealed 4 issues that needed fixing before full test suite execution. All issues have been resolved.

---

## Issue 1: Password Strength Showing 8 Characters ✅

**Problem**: SignUpForm displayed "Must be at least 8 characters long" but backend validation required 12 characters.

**Root Cause**: UI text not updated when password requirements changed from 8 to 12 characters.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Line 333: "8 characters" → "12 characters long with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character"
- Line 335: `password.length < 8` → `password.length < 12`
- Line 339: `password.length >= 8` → `password.length >= 12`
- Line 356: `password.length >= 8` → `password.length >= 12`

**Verification**:

1. Visit `/auth?mode=signup`
2. Enter password less than 12 characters
3. Verify error shows "12 characters" requirement
4. Verify all validation checks enforce 12 character minimum

## Issue 2: Forgot Password Not Linked ✅

**Problem**: SignInForm had TODO comment and alert() instead of actual forgot password link.

**Root Cause**: Forgot password functionality was implemented (`/auth/forgot-password` page exists) but not connected to the sign-in form.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`

**Changes**:

```diff
- <button
-   type="button"
-   onClick={() => {
-     // TODO: Implement forgot password functionality
-     alert("Forgot password functionality coming soon!");
-   }}
- >
-   Forgot password?
- </button>
+ <a href="/auth/forgot-password">
+   Forgot password?
+ </a>
```

**Verification**:

1. Visit `/auth?mode=signin`
2. Click "Forgot password?" link
3. Verify navigation to `/auth/forgot-password`
4. Complete password reset flow

---

## Issue 3: Security Link Missing from Staff Dashboard ✅

**Problem**: Staff dashboard page had links to verification, charters, media, and registrations but was missing security link.

**Root Cause**: Security dashboard (`/staff/security`) was implemented but not added to navigation.

**Files Changed**:

- `src/app/(admin)/staff/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
Added new Link component after registrations link:

```tsx
<Link
  href="/staff/security"
  className="group flex items-center justify-between rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4 hover:shadow-md"
>
  <div>
    <div className="font-medium text-slate-800">User Security</div>
    <div className="text-sm text-slate-600">
      Manage user accounts and security events
    </div>
  </div>
  <span className="text-slate-400 group-hover:text-slate-600">→</span>
</Link>
```

**Verification**:

1. Login as STAFF or ADMIN user
2. Visit `/staff`
3. Verify "User Security" link is visible
4. Click link to verify navigation to `/staff/security`

## Issue 4: OTP Verification Missing During Registration ✅

**Problem**: Registration flow created users immediately without email verification. Users could sign up and log in without verifying their email address.

**Root Cause**: Original signup API directly created users with `emailVerified: null` and didn't implement OTP verification step.

**Solution Implemented**: Complete email verification flow using existing OTP infrastructure:

### Flow Overview

```
1. User submits signup form
2. API creates user with emailVerified: null
3. API generates 6-digit OTP
4. API sends verification email
5. User redirected to /auth/verify-otp?email=...&purpose=email_verification
6. User enters OTP code
7. API validates OTP and sets emailVerified: DateTime
8. User redirected to dashboard
```

### Files Changed

#### 1. `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Complete Rewrite

**Added Imports**:

```typescript
import { createOTP } from "@/lib/auth/otp";
import { sendVerificationOTP } from "@/lib/email";
import { applySecurityHeaders } from "@/lib/headers";
import { rateLimit } from "@/lib/rateLimiter";
```

**Key Changes**:

- Added rate limiting: 3 signup attempts per hour per email
- Create user with `emailVerified: null` (unverified by default)
- Generate OTP using `createOTP(email, "email_verification")`
- Send verification email using `sendVerificationOTP(email, firstName, code)`
- Return `requiresVerification: true` in response
- Apply security headers to all responses

#### 2. `src/app/api/auth/verify-otp/route.ts` - Email Verification

**Added Import**:

```typescript
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";
```

**Added Logic** (after successful OTP validation):

```typescript
// If email verification, mark email as verified
if (purpose === "email_verification") {
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { email: normalizedEmail },
    data: { emailVerified: new Date() },
  });
}
```

#### 3. `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Redirect to Verification

**Changed Response Handling**:

```typescript
const data = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));

if (!res.ok) {
  // ... error handling with 429 rate limit support
}

// If email verification is required, redirect to verify-otp page
if (data.requiresVerification) {
  setAccountCreated(true);
  const verifyUrl = `/auth/verify-otp?email=${encodeURIComponent(
    data.email || email
  )}&purpose=email_verification&callbackUrl=${encodeURIComponent(next)}`;
  window.location.href = verifyUrl;
} else {
  // Fallback: auto-login for legacy flow (shouldn't happen anymore)
  // ... existing auto-login code
}
```

#### 4. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Block Unverified Logins

**Updated Credentials Provider**:

```typescript
async authorize(credentials) {
  if (!credentials?.email || !credentials.password) return null;
  const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
    where: { email: credentials.email },
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      name: true,
      passwordHash: true,
      emailVerified: true, // ← Added to select
    },
  });
  if (!user?.passwordHash) return null;

  // Check if email is verified
  if (!user.emailVerified) {
    throw new Error(
      "Email not verified. Please check your email for the verification code."
    );
  }

  const valid = await bcrypt.compare(credentials.password, user.passwordHash);
  if (!valid) return null;
  return { id: user.id, email: user.email, name: user.name };
}
```

### Verification Steps

**Test Registration Flow**:

1. Visit `/auth?mode=signup`
2. Fill in all fields (email, password 12+ chars, first name, last name)
3. Submit form
4. Verify redirect to `/auth/verify-otp` page
5. Check email for 6-digit verification code
6. Enter code in verification page
7. Verify redirect to captain dashboard after successful verification

**Test Unverified Login Block**:

1. Create new account (don't verify email)
2. Try to sign in with same credentials
3. Verify error: "Email not verified. Please check your email for the verification code."
4. Verify user cannot access protected routes

**Test Resend OTP**:

1. During verification, wait for 60 second countdown
2. Click "Resend Code" button
3. Verify new code received in email
4. Verify old code no longer works

**Test OTP Expiration**:

1. Create new account
2. Wait 5+ minutes (OTP_LIMITS.CODE_EXPIRY_MINUTES)
3. Try to use expired code
4. Verify error: "Verification code expired. Please request a new one."

**Test Rate Limiting**:

1. Try to create 4 accounts with same email in under 1 hour
2. Verify 4th attempt returns 429 error
3. Verify error: "Too many signup attempts. Please try again later."

**Test OAuth Users** (no email verification required):

1. Sign in with Google OAuth
2. Verify immediate access (no OTP verification)
3. Verify `emailVerified` is set by OAuth flow

---

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **User Creation Timing**: Users are created immediately with `emailVerified: null` rather than after OTP verification. This simplifies the flow and allows using existing OTP infrastructure that requires a user record.

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Kept fallback auto-login code in SignUpForm for legacy users, though new flow always returns `requiresVerification: true`.

3. **OAuth Exemption**: OAuth users don't require email verification since the OAuth provider (Google) already verified the email address.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Added 3 attempts per hour rate limit to prevent abuse and email spam.

### Security Considerations

- ✅ Rate limiting on signup (3/hour) and OTP verification (10/15min)
- ✅ OTP codes expire after 5 minutes
- ✅ Maximum 5 verification attempts before 15-minute lockout
- ✅ 60-second cooldown between OTP resend requests
- ✅ Email verification required before accessing protected routes
- ✅ Clear error messages without leaking security information

### Dependencies Used

- **OTP System**: `src/lib/auth/otp.ts` (existing)

  - `createOTP()` - Generate and store 6-digit code
  - `validateOTP()` - Verify code with attempt tracking
  - `canRequestOTP()` - Check resend cooldown

- **Email System**: `src/lib/email.ts` (existing)

  - `sendVerificationOTP()` - Send branded verification email

- **Verification UI**: `src/app/(auth)/verify-otp/page.tsx` (existing)
  - Generic OTP verification page with purpose parameter
  - 6-digit code input with error handling
  - Resend functionality with countdown
