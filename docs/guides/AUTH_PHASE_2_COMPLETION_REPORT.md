2. **No Notification After Reset**

   - User doesn't get confirmation email
   - **Future**: Send "Password changed" notification

3. **No Password History**

   - Users can reuse old passwords
   - **Future**: Store password history hash

4. **No Admin Override**
   - Support can't reset user passwords
   - **Future**: Admin tools for account management

### Enhancement Ideas

1. **Progressive Security**

   - Detect suspicious reset attempts
   - Additional verification for unusual activity
   - Geographic anomaly detection

2. **Password Strength Meter**

   - Visual indicator (weak/medium/strong)
   - Real-time feedback as user types
   - Use zxcvbn library for accurate strength

3. **Recovery Alternatives**
   - Security questions (fallback method)
   - SMS-based OTP (if phone on file)
   - Admin-initiated reset

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully implements a complete, secure password reset flow that:

- **Empowers users** to recover their accounts independently
- **Maintains security** with OTP verification and strong password rules
- **Prevents abuse** through rate limiting and attempt tracking
- **Provides excellent UX** with clear messaging and visual feedback
