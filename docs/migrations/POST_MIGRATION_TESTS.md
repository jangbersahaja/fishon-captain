## Database Validation Queries

### Check CharterMedia Distribution

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_captain,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "charterId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_charter,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NOT NULL AND "charterId" IS NULL THEN 1 END) as pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NULL AND "charterId" IS NULL THEN 1 END) as orphan
FROM "CharterMedia";
```

### Check CaptainVideo Linking

```sql
SELECT
  "processStatus",
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "charterId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as linked_to_charter,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "charterMediaId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as finalized
FROM "CaptainVideo"
GROUP BY "processStatus";
```

### Find Orphaned Media

```sql
-- True orphans (no captain or charter)
SELECT id, kind, storageKey, "createdAt"
FROM "CharterMedia"
WHERE "captainId" IS NULL AND "charterId" IS NULL
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

### Verify Bidirectional Video Linking

```sql
SELECT
  cv.id as video_id,
  cv."charterId",
  cv."charterMediaId",
  cm.id as charter_media_id,
  cm."charterId" as cm_charter_id
FROM "CaptainVideo" cv
LEFT JOIN "CharterMedia" cm ON cm.id = cv."charterMediaId"
WHERE cv."charterMediaId" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Multiple Drafts Share Photos

**Description:** Captain with multiple drafts will have all photos linked to charter on finalize

**Status:** ✅ By Design  
**Impact:** Low (captains typically have 1 active draft)  
**Workaround:** Captain controls which photos via UI  
**Future Enhancement:** Add `draftId` to CharterMedia for tighter scoping

### Issue 2: No Automatic Cleanup

**Description:** Deleted drafts don't clean up CharterMedia

**Status:** ✅ By Design  
**Impact:** Low (media belongs to captain, not draft)  
**Workaround:** Manual SQL cleanup if needed  
**Future Enhancement:** Add cron job for old temp media

### Issue 3: Duplicate Upload Detection

**Description:** Same file can be uploaded multiple times

**Status:** ✅ Known Limitation  
**Impact:** Low (rare occurrence)  
**Workaround:** Captain can delete duplicates via UI  
**Future Enhancement:** Hash-based deduplication
