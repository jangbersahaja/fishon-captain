---

## Deployment Plan

### Pre-Deployment Checklist ✅

- [x] All tests passing (10/10)
- [x] Migrations applied in staging
- [x] Rollback procedures documented
- [x] Team briefed on changes
- [x] Monitoring alerts configured
- [x] Success metrics defined

### Deployment Steps

**Recommended:** Single deployment (no phased rollout)

**Reason:** Migration is non-breaking and backward compatible

```bash
# 1. Backup database (precautionary)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_pre_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 3. Verify migration status
npx prisma migrate status
# Expected: All migrations applied, no pending

# 4. Deploy application
vercel --prod

# 5. Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com/health
# Expected: 200 OK
```

### Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

**Critical Metrics:**

1. **Finalization Success Rate**

   - Monitor `/api/charter-drafts/[id]/finalize` endpoint
   - Expected: No increase in failures
   - Alert threshold: >5% failure rate

2. **CharterMedia Creation Rate**

   - Monitor `/api/media/photo` endpoint
   - Expected: All photos get `captainId`
   - Alert threshold: <95% with captainId

3. **Error Logs**

   - Watch for "missing_captain_profile" errors
   - Watch for "rate_limited" spikes
   - Alert threshold: >10 errors/hour

4. **Admin Inventory**
   - Verify `/staff/media` loads correctly
   - Check pending media displays properly
   - Alert threshold: Page load >3s

**Validation SQL** (Run after 1 hour):

```sql
-- Verify CharterMedia distribution
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_captain,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "charterId" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_charter,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NOT NULL AND "charterId" IS NULL THEN 1 END) as pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN "captainId" IS NULL AND "charterId" IS NULL THEN 1 END) as orphan
FROM "CharterMedia"
WHERE "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

-- Expected: 100% of new photos have captainId
-- Expected: Orphan count = 0 or very low
```

### Success Criteria

Deploy is considered **successful** if after 24 hours:

- ✅ Finalization success rate unchanged (no regression)
- ✅ 100% of new photos have `captainId`
- ✅ Orphan media count remains low (<5%)
- ✅ Admin inventory loads in <3s
- ✅ No increase in support tickets
- ✅ All post-deployment SQL queries show expected results

---

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Consider rollback if:**

- Finalization failure rate >10%
- Critical bugs in media upload flow
- Database integrity issues
- Performance degradation >50%

### Rollback Steps

**Option 1: Quick Revert (Recommended if needed)**

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment
vercel rollback

# 2. Verify rollback
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# 3. Monitor for stabilization
# Check error logs, finalization rate
```

**Option 2: Database Rollback (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

Database rollback is **NOT RECOMMENDED** because:

- Schema changes are non-breaking
- No data loss with current schema
- `captainId` and `charterMediaId` fields are safe to keep
- Rolling back migrations could cause data integrity issues

**If absolutely necessary:**

```bash
# 1. Revert application
vercel rollback

# 2. Mark migrations as reverted (DO NOT drop tables)
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20251018_add_chartermedia_id_to_captain_video

# 3. Keep captainId field (safe to keep)
# This allows future migration retry
```

### Rollback Impact

- ✅ **Low Risk:** Application code reverts cleanly
- ✅ **No Data Loss:** Schema changes are additive only
- ✅ **Quick Recovery:** Deployment rollback takes <5 minutes
- ⚠️ **Consideration:** New photos uploaded during deployed window will have `captainId` (this is safe)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas ✅

- **Database Schema Changes:** Additive only, no breaking changes
- **Existing Data:** All charters continue working (backfill complete)
- **API Compatibility:** Finalize endpoint accepts empty body (backward compatible)
- **User Experience:** No visible changes to captain flow

### Medium Risk Areas ⚠️

- **New Finalization Logic:** Changed from payload to canonical queries

  - **Mitigation:** Extensively tested (10 unit tests, integration tests)
  - **Rollback:** Quick deployment revert available

- **Admin Inventory Changes:** New pending/orphan detection logic
  - **Mitigation:** Tested with various scenarios
  - **Impact:** Admin-only, doesn't affect captains

### High Risk Areas ❌ NONE

No high-risk areas identified. All changes are backward compatible and extensively tested.

---

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders

1. **Development Team**

   - Briefed on migration changes
   - On-call for first 24 hours post-deployment
   - Access to rollback procedures

2. **Support Team**

   - No captain-facing changes expected
   - Monitor for unusual media upload tickets
   - Escalation path to dev team established

3. **Users (Captains)**
   - No communication needed (transparent changes)
   - Improved UX: early photo upload capability
   - Better error messages if issues occur

### Escalation Path

**If issues arise:**

1. **Tier 1:** Development team reviews error logs
2. **Tier 2:** Run post-deployment validation SQL
3. **Tier 3:** Consider rollback if critical
4. **Tier 4:** Contact DevOps for database support
