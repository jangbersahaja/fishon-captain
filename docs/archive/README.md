# Historical Documentation Archive

This directory contains completion reports, phase summaries, and implementation notes from past development work. These documents are kept for historical reference but are not active guides.

## üìã What's Here

### Phase Completion Reports

Development work was organized in phases. Each phase has a completion report documenting what was accomplished:

- **Phase 2A** - Safe deletions of unused endpoints
- **Phase 2B** - Worker consolidation and analysis
- **Phase 2C** - Blob upload migration to dual pipeline (CURRENT)
- **Phase 13** - Enhanced video uploader migration

### Implementation Completion Docs

These document specific features that were implemented:

- **30s Trim Implementation** - Video trim modal with 30-second limit
- **Auto-Trim Modal** - Automatic trim UI for oversized videos
- **WhatsApp-Style Trim UI** - User-friendly video trimming interface
- **Toast Persistence Fix** - Fixed toast notifications persisting across sessions
- **PendingMedia Cleanup** - Removal of legacy PendingMedia model
- **Video Upload Migration** - Migration from legacy to enhanced uploader

### Planning & Status Documents

- **API Cleanup Progress** - Historical tracking of API cleanup phases
- **Video Upload Phases Status** - Phase-by-phase status tracker (superseded)

### Legacy README

- **README_OLD_LEGACY.md** - Old root README before October 2025 documentation reorganization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **These docs are READ-ONLY** - Don't update completion reports after they're archived
2. **Use for historical context** - If you need to understand why something was done
3. **Active docs are elsewhere** - Current guides are in `/docs/guides/`, API docs in `/docs/api/`
4. **Phase numbering** - Some phase numbers skip (e.g., 2A, 2B, 2C, then 13) due to parallel work streams
