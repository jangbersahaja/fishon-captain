# Video Upload System

## Summary

Comprehensive video upload, processing, and management system with client-side trimming, queue-based uploads with retry logic, server-side normalization, and dual-pipeline architecture for zero-downtime migration.

---

## Current Architecture

### Client-Side Components

**EnhancedVideoUploader** (`src/components/captain/EnhancedVideoUploader.tsx`)

- Queue-based upload system with IndexedDB persistence
- Automatic video trimming for files >30s or >720p
- Progress tracking and retry logic
- Concurrent upload management (max 3 simultaneous)

**VideoTrimModal** (`src/components/captain/VideoTrimModal.tsx`)

- WhatsApp-style trim UI with drag handles
- 30-second maximum trim length enforcement
- Real-time bitrate-based size estimation
- Client-side MP4 slicing via `trimMp4Slice.ts`

**VideoManager** (`src/components/captain/VideoManager.tsx`)

- Display processed videos with status badges
- Thumbnail generation and preview
- Delete and retry capabilities

### Upload Queue System

**VideoUploadQueue** (`src/lib/uploads/videoQueue.ts`)

- Three-phase upload: `create` â†’ multipart chunks â†’ `finish`
- IndexedDB persistence across page refreshes
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Discriminated union types for type safety

**Queue Storage** (`src/lib/storage/queueStorage.ts`)

- IndexedDB wrapper for queue state
- Atomic updates and conflict resolution
- Automatic cleanup of completed uploads

### Server-Side Processing

**Dual Pipeline Architecture** (Phase 2C-1 Complete)

```
Upload â†’ CaptainVideo Creation â†’ NEW Pipeline + Legacy Pipeline
                                       â†“              â†“
                              /api/videos/queue   /api/jobs/transcode
                                       â†“              â†“
                               External Worker    Legacy Worker
                                       â†“              â†“
                                 Normalized       Transcoded
                                   (720p)          (legacy)
```

**NEW Pipeline** (Active):

1. Client uploads to Vercel Blob
2. Creates `CaptainVideo` record (status: `queued`)
3. Calls `/api/videos/queue` with `videoId`
4. External worker normalizes to 720p
5. Worker calls `/api/videos/normalize-callback`
6. Updates `CaptainVideo` (status: `ready`)

**Legacy Pipeline** (Fallback):

- Still runs in parallel for safety
- Will be deprecated in Phase 2D

### Video Status Lifecycle

```
queued â†’ processing â†’ ready
   â†“
failed (retryable)
   â†“
cancelled (during deletion)
```

---

## API Routes

### Upload & Finish

**POST `/api/blob/upload`**

- Accepts video files (mp4, mov, webm, etc.)
- Size limit: 50MB for short videos
- Creates temp blob key: `temp/{charterId}/original/{filename}`
- Creates `CaptainVideo` record
- Queues both NEW and legacy pipelines

**POST `/api/blob/finish`**

- Called after multipart upload completes
- Probes video dimensions with ffprobe
- Sets `processedDurationSec`
- Decides bypass vs normalization
- Enqueues `/api/videos/queue` if needed

### Video Processing

**POST `/api/videos/queue`**

- Validates `videoId` exists
- Updates status to `processing`
- Sends job to external worker (QStash in prod)
- Returns immediately (async processing)

**POST `/api/videos/normalize-callback`**

- Receives worker completion notification
- Updates `CaptainVideo` with normalized URLs
- Sets status to `ready` or `failed`
- Generates thumbnail blob key

**GET `/api/captain/videos`**

- Lists captain's processed videos
- Returns status, URLs, thumbnails
- Supports pagination and filtering

### Video Management

**DELETE `/api/captain/videos/:id`**

- Marks video as `cancelled`
- Worker checks status before processing (graceful)
- Deletes blob keys: original, 720p, thumbnail
- Sets `originalDeletedAt` timestamp

---

## Database Schema

**CaptainVideo Model**:

```prisma
model CaptainVideo {
  id                   String    @id @default(cuid())
  ownerId              String
  originalUrl          String
  blobKey              String?   // original blob key
  trimStartSec         Float     @default(0)
  ready720pUrl         String?
  ready720pBlobKey     String?
  thumbnailBlobKey     String?
  processStatus        String    // queued|processing|ready|failed|cancelled
  errorMessage         String?
  didFallback          Boolean   @default(false)
  fallbackReason       String?
  processedDurationSec Float?
  originalDeletedAt    DateTime?
  createdAt            DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt            DateTime  @updatedAt
  owner                User      @relation(fields: [ownerId], references: [id])
}
```

## Key Features

### 30-Second Trim Enforcement

- Auto-opens trim modal for videos >30s
- Prevents upload of untrimmed long videos
- Estimates trimmed file size before upload
- Client-side MP4 slicing (no server upload needed)

### Queue Persistence

- Survives page refresh via IndexedDB
- Resumes incomplete uploads automatically
- Tracks retry attempts and errors
- Atomic state updates prevent corruption

### Retry Logic

- Exponential backoff: 1s â†’ 2s â†’ 4s â†’ 8s
- Max 3 retry attempts per upload
- Preserves queue position across retries
- User can manually retry failed uploads

### Concurrent Upload Limits

- Max 3 simultaneous uploads
- Queued uploads wait for slots
- Fair queue ordering (FIFO)
- Prevents browser/server overload

### Graceful Degradation

- Bypass normalization for compliant videos (â‰¤30s, â‰¤720p)
- Fallback to original if normalization fails
- Dual pipeline ensures legacy compatibility
- Sets `didFallback` flag for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails Immediately

**Symptoms:** Video upload fails on start, no retry
**Causes:**

- File size exceeds 50MB limit
- Invalid file format (not mp4/mov/webm)
- Missing `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`

**Solutions:**

1. Check file size in browser DevTools
2. Verify file extension is supported
3. Ensure env var is set in Vercel dashboard

### Upload Stuck at "Processing"

**Symptoms:** Video status remains `processing` >10 minutes
**Causes:**

- External worker not running
- Worker crashed during normalization
- Network timeout to worker

**Solutions:**

1. Check worker logs (Vercel Functions or QStash)
2. Verify `EXTERNAL_WORKER_URL` is correct
3. Manually retry via admin panel

### Video Shows as "Failed"

**Symptoms:** Status changes from `processing` to `failed`
**Causes:**

- Normalization error (corrupt video, unsupported codec)
- Worker exception (ffmpeg crash)
- Callback delivery failure

**Solutions:**

1. Check worker error logs for ffmpeg output
2. Download original and test with ffmpeg locally
3. Re-upload with different encoding

### Queue Not Persisting Across Refresh

**Symptoms:** Upload queue resets after page reload
**Causes:**

- IndexedDB disabled in browser
- Private/incognito mode
- Browser storage quota exceeded

**Solutions:**

1. Enable IndexedDB in browser settings
2. Use regular browsing mode
3. Clear IndexedDB storage and retry
